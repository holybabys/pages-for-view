        of implementing the AML Policy. This information is processed and stored strictly in accordance with the BORSA

        older than 3 months, which indicates the full name of the User and his actual place of residence. <br>
        The BORSA Service verifies the authenticity of documents and information provided by Users and reserves the right
        to receive additional information about Users who have been identified as dangerous or suspicious. <br>

        has the right to request updated documents from the User, even if they have been authenticated in the past.
